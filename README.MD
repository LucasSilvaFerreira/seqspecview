## SeqSpecView
Generate a view for the seqspec.yaml file  (https://github.com/IGVF/seqspec)

This will not work with files containing more than one hierarchy level.
This will present a separate view for each modality (considering each modality a region) See 10xCRISPR_spec.yaml.

## Usage
```
python seqspecview.py seqspec.yaml
```


## Example
```
python seqspecview.py 10xCRISPR_spec.yaml
```
Open render.html to see all the views
